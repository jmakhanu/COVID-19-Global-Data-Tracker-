#Title_ COVID-19 Global Data TrackerProject 
 #Description
This project is a data analysis and reporting notebook (or application) designed to track global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across various countries and over time.
 The project involves cleaning and processing real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insights, and visualizing trends using Python data tools.
 By the end of this project, you will have a data analysis report with compelling visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.
 Project Objectives :Import and clean COVID-19 global data: Obtain data from reliable sources and prepare it for analysis.Analyze time trends: Investigate patterns in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.Compare metrics: Analyze and compare key COVID-19 metrics across different countries and regions.Visualize trends: Create informative charts and maps to illustrate data trends.Communicate findings: Summarize insights in a clear, well-documented report.

#Project Description
This project is a data analysis and reporting notebook (or application) designed to track global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across various countries and over time. The project involves cleaning and processing real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insights, and visualizing trends using Python data tools.

By the end of this project, you will have a data analysis report with compelling visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

Project Objectives
Import and clean COVID-19 global data: Obtain data from reliable sources and prepare it for analysis.

Analyze time trends: Investigate patterns in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.

Compare metrics: Analyze and compare key COVID-19 metrics across different countries and regions.

Visualize trends: Create informative charts and maps to illustrate data trends.

Communicate findings: Summarize insights in a clear, well-documented report.

Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)
1. Data Collection
Goal: Obtain a reliable COVID-19 dataset.

Data Source: Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset (CSV)

Action: Download owid-covid-data.csv from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv and save it in your project's working directory.

2. Data Loading & Exploration
Goal: Load the dataset and explore its structure.

Tasks:

Load data using pandas.read_csv().

Check column names.

Preview the first few rows.

Identify missing values.

Tools: pandas

Key columns: date, location, total_cases, total_deaths, new_cases, new_deaths, total_vaccinations, etc.

3. Data Cleaning
Goal: Prepare data for analysis.

Tasks:

Filter countries of interest (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).

Drop rows with missing critical values (e.g., date, location).

Convert the date column to datetime objects.

Handle missing numeric values (e.g., fill with 0 or interpolate).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goal: Generate descriptive statistics & explore trends.

Tasks:

Plot total cases and total deaths over time for selected countries.

Compare daily new cases between countries.

Calculate the death rate (total_deaths / total_cases).

Visualizations: Line charts, Bar charts.

Tools: matplotlib, seaborn

5. Visualizing Vaccination Progress
Goal: Analyze vaccination rollouts.

Tasks:

Plot cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.

Compare the percentage of vaccinated and fully vaccinated populations.

Charts: Line charts, Bar charts.

Tools: matplotlib, seaborn

6. Optional: Build a Choropleth Map
Goal: Visualize cases or vaccination rates by country on a world map.

Tools: Plotly Express

Tasks:

Prepare data with iso_code and relevant metrics for the latest date.

Plot a choropleth map showing case density or vaccination rates.

7. Insights & Reporting
Goal: Summarize findings.

Tasks:

Write 3-5 key insights derived from the data and visualizations.

Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.

Use narrative explanations alongside your code and visuals.

Deliverables: A well-documented Jupyter Notebook (or Python script output) combining code, visualizations, and narrative explanations.

Recommended Tools
Python 3

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly (optional, for choropleth maps)

Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)

How to Run the Project
Download the Data:
Download the owid-covid-data.csv file from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv
Save this file in the same directory as your Python script.

Install Dependencies:
If you don't have the required libraries installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

Run the Python Script:
Save the provided Python code (e.g., as covid_tracker.py) in the same directory as the owid-covid-data.csv file. Then, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to that directory, and run:

python covid_tracker.py

If you are using a Jupyter Notebook, you can paste the code into cells and run them sequentially.

View Outputs:
The script will generate several plots that will appear in separate windows (or inline if using Jupyter). Close each plot to proceed. If Plotly is used, interactive maps will open in your web browser. The console will also display various data exploration outputs and prompts for your insights.

Enjoy tracking global COVID-19 trends!
